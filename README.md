# C# synchronization primitives 

Here is the learning playground for synchronization primitives like:
- lock,
- Monitor,
- AutoResetEvent,
- Mutex,
- Semaphore.

Here are also emulated 2 situations with a **DeadLock**.

Hope these examples will help you explore this topic and will provide you with alternatives!

Please feel free to extend this repo with more examples since here only the basic level covered still.
